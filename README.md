### **Live Markdown Preview**

#### This is a simple Web App that generates live preview of the Markdown code that you write. This can be a pretty handy tool when you want to know how your **README File** will look like in the Github Repository before making a commit.

#### I've also added a feature of **Local Storage**, so that if page is refreshed by mistake, the code written will be saved on local storage of browser and fetched when you open the site again.
